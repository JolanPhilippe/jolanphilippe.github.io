                    From 2017 to 2019, I worked at Northern Arizona University as a graduate research assistant for Frederic Loulergue. During this time, my focus was on the Systematic Development of Efficient Programs on Parallel Data Structures.

                    In 2019, I began working at IMT Atlantique, Nantes, where I pursued my PhD in the Naomod and STACK teams. Under the joint supervision of Gerson Sunye, Massimo Tisi, and Helene Coullon, my research delved into the field of Model Driven Engineering. My thesis, titled "Contribution to the analysis of the design-space of a distributed transformation engine," was successfully defended in 2022.

                    Since 2023, I have held a postdoctoral position at IMT Atlantique, working under the supervision of Helene Coullon and Charles Prud'Hommes. Currently, I am actively involved in the SeMaFoR project, where my focus lies in the decentralization of distributed systems reconfiguration through the utilization of constraint programming.

                    As an adventurous individual who thrives on pushing limits, running has become a cornerstone of my life. I've challenged myself with numerous marathons around the world. From the dazzling lights of Las Vegas to the romantic streets of Paris and the rugged terrain of SP Crater, each marathon has been a journey of self-discovery and determination.

                    Fuelled by a passion for exploration, I've embarked on countless trips to immerse myself in diverse cultures and landscapes. From the tranquil temples of Laos to the bustling streets of Bangkok, and from the iconic landmarks of the United States to the picturesque villages of Italy and Spain, I've found joy in experiencing the richness and diversity of our world. With each journey, I embrace the unknown, seeking new adventures and forging unforgettable memories along the way.
