                    Since September 2025, I have been an Associate Professor (Maître de conférences) in computer science at Université d’Orléans, within the LMV team of LIFO. I am currently involved in the Taranis project, the ANR ForCoala project on the verification of a configuration language (Ansible), and the UniVerSE project, which focuses on the verification of spaces of configurations.

                <p>
                    From 2017 to 2019, I worked at Northern Arizona University as a graduate research assistant under the supervision of Frederic Loulergue. During this time, my research focused on the systematic development of efficient programs on parallel data structures.

                <p> 
                    In 2019, I joined IMT Atlantique in Nantes, where I pursued my PhD within the Naomod and STACK teams. Under the joint supervision of Gerson Sunye, Massimo Tisi, and Helene Coullon, my research explored the field of Model-Driven Engineering. My thesis, entitled “Contribution to the analysis of the design space of a distributed transformation engine,” was successfully defended in 2022.

                <p> 
                    Between February 2023 and July 2024, I held a postdoctoral position at IMT Atlantique under the supervision of Helene Coullon and Charles Prud’Homme. I contributed to the SeMaFoR project, focusing on the decentralization of distributed systems reconfiguration through the use of constraint programming.

                <p> 
                    From August 2024 to August 2025, I held a postdoctoral position at Université de Rennes within the DiverSE team, under the supervision of Olivier Barais. During this period, I was involved in the Taranis project, initiated in the context of PEPR Cloud.

                Running is an important part of my personal life. I regularly participate in long-distance races, including marathons. Some of my past results are available <a href="running.html">here</a>
                I also enjoy traveling and discovering new places and cultures. I have visited several countries in Southeast Asia, North America, and Europe. These experiences have allowed me to broaden my perspective and appreciate cultural diversity.
