                <p>
                    From 2017 to 2019, I worked at Northern Arizona University as a graduate research assistant for Frederic Loulergue. During this time, my focus was on the Systematic Development of Efficient Programs on Parallel Data Structures.

                    In 2019, I began working at IMT Atlantique, Nantes, where I pursued my PhD in the Naomod and STACK teams. Under the joint supervision of Gerson Sunye, Massimo Tisi, and Helene Coullon, my research delved into the field of Model Driven Engineering. My thesis, titled "Contribution to the analysis of the design-space of a distributed transformation engine," was successfully defended in 2022.

                    Since 2023, I have held a postdoctoral position at IMT Atlantique, working under the supervision of Helene Coullon and Charles Prud'Hommes. Currently, I am actively involved in the SeMaFoR project, where my focus lies in the decentralization of distributed systems reconfiguration through the utilization of constraint programming.
